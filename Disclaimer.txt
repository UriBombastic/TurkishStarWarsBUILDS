This "game" is based off the 1982 film "Dünyayi Kurtaran Adam (The Man Who Saved The World) by Çetin Inanç,
Better known as "Turkish Star Wars" for its use of footage from the Star Wars movies.
To pay homage to the original movie, this game utilizes pretty much whatever 3D models and audio clips
I could find for free online, including music from other video games and other forms of media.
Therefore, I am claiming no ownership over any of the models, sound effects, or ESPECIALLY music 
Utilized in this, even though quite a bit is modified to fit my vision. 
All sounds, images, and 3D models used from external sources are cited in Credits.txt.
This game is purely for entertainment purposes, 
Honestly mostly for myself but if you get a kick out of it too that would be ideal.
